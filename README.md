# Neovim and Nix Simple Example

This is a basic example of how to make your own custom nix-based neovim package with dependencies, plugins, and configs all wrapped together. It has a preference for using lua configs for neovim. This is essentially a very boiled down version of my own neovim config: [pwnvim](https://github.com/zmre/pwnvim/).

If you have nix installed, you can run something like, `nix run github:zmre/neovim-nix-simple-example` except since you'll be copying this code (or forking or whatever works) you will likely prefer to substitute your own repo.

This repo was made as a companion to an explainer video on YouTube.
